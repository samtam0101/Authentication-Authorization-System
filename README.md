# Authentication-Authorization-System
This project is a robust, secure, and scalable authentication and authorization backend system developed using ASP.NET Core Web API and Entity Framework Core. 
The system is designed to serve as a foundational layer for any modern web, desktop, or mobile application that requires secure user management and access control.

It follows best practices in API design, authentication flows, and layered architecture. The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication and ASP.NET Identity for managing users, passwords, and roles. The codebase is modular, testable, and ready for integration with any frontend (e.g., React, Angular, Blazor, Flutter, etc.).
